  Based on the provided project details, suggest 2-3 distinct targeting strategies for an ad campaign on platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google.

  **TODO: The project data should be fetched from a database using the projectId.**

      - **Strategy 2: The International Investor**: Use 'Detailed Targeting' for individuals in key international markets known for investing in this city.
      - **Strategy 3: Past Buyer Lookalikes**: Suggest creating a 'Lookalike Audience' based on past buyer profiles to find similar users.
  3.  **Detail Each Strategy**: For each strategy, provide a clear name, the audience type, and a detailed breakdown of:
      - **Demographics:** Location, Age, Language, etc.
      - **Interests (for Facebook/Instagram):** Specific, actionable interests to target.
      - **Keywords (for Google Ads):** High-intent keywords for search campaigns.
