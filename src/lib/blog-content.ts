With our Automated Rebranding tool, you can make any marketing material your own in less time than it takes to make a coffee.",

            { heading: "The Branding Bottleneck", body: "Getting your brand onto marketing materials is crucial for building name recognition and trust. But it's often a frustrating bottleneck.

            { heading: "The 'Credibility' Prompt", body: "When using any AI image tool, a buyer's brain is subconsciously looking for tells that an image is 'fake' or low-effort. You can overcome this by adding a simple phrase to your prompt: 'shot on cinematic camera, 35mm lens'. This doesn't just change the image; it changes the viewer's perception." },
            { heading: "Why This Works", body: "This phrase signals to the AI that you want an image with specific professional characteristics: a shallow depth of field (blurry background), realistic lighting, and a composition that feels intentional and high-end. The result is an image that feels less like a stock photo and more like a professional photoshoot, immediately boosting its credibility and stopping the scroll." },
            { heading: "When to Use It", body: "Use this modifier in the Story Designer, Reel Designer, or even when generating a new logo. Anytime you need a visual that feels authentic and commands trust, add this phrase to your prompt. It's a small tweak that makes a massive difference in how your marketing is perceived." }
